## Summary

This system is designed to help match volunteers with the families of current and past United States Armed Forces personnel.

Service members or immediate family can sign up as Service Recipients and post needs to the system. A list qualified volunteers qualified for the need will be displayed by the system. The Service Recipient will be able to send a request to volunteers from this listing.

Volunteers will sign up and create a volunteer profile. In the profile Volunteers will specify what services they can provide. Volunteers will also set the geographic area the volunteer is willing to service. Volunteers can browse available service requests and apply to assist. The recipient will accept service requests sent by volunteers.

Contact between the recipient and the volunteer will be established via this system.
